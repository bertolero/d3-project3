# EACCESS ERROR FIX
```diff
- how to fix the EACCESS ERROR
- lets say for example you trying to install webpack
- sudo npm install webpack@4.25.1 -g
- and get an error
- Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/webpack/node_modules/fsevents/build'
- then try again to install it but with this at the end "--unsafe-perm=true --allow-root"
- for example
- sudo npm install webpack@4.25.1 -g --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```
or 

npm install har-validator@latest --save-dev
